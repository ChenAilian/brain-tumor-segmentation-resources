data pre processing, reference:

this uses brats 2013 data, tested and able to correctly process all image data

https://github.com/cvdlab/nn-segmentation-for-lar

tested, doesn't run has bugs, still trying to make this work

https://github.com/naldeborgh7575/brain_segmentation

process our data:

skull strip

downsize x and y dimensions (brats 2013 x,y is 160,216, brats 2015 is 240, 240, ours is 640,640)

make more layers, z dimension (brats 2013 had 176 layers, 2015 had 155 layers, ours only 24)

then feed all data to the pre-processing pipeline similar to github examples.
